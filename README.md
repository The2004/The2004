<h1>Who is 2004?</h1>
<p>I'm an 18-year-old male with a passion for game development, particularly in Unity. I have gained valuable experience in this field and have honed my skills in various programming languages, including JavaScript, C#, Python, and PHP. While I can effectively collaborate and contribute in team environments, I find solace and thrive when working independently. Throughout my journey, I have successfully completed numerous projects solely, which I proudly shared and published on GitHub. With a strong foundation in programming and a fervent drive for creating engaging experiences, I'm eager to continue pushing the boundaries of game development and expanding my knowledge in the field.</p><!---
